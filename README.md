# Simple Linear Regression with CO2 Emissions Data

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to perform simple linear regression using Python. It focuses on predicting CO2 emissions based on various features of a car.

## Objectives

- Import necessary Python libraries
- Download and read the dataset
- Perform data exploration and visualization
- Select relevant features for regression
- Create and evaluate a simple linear regression model

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook contains information about different cars and their corresponding CO2 emissions. It is read from a CSV file and explored to understand its basic statistics and distributions.

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

2. Download the dataset and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
   
3. Open the notebook and execute the cells one by one, following the instructions and comments.
